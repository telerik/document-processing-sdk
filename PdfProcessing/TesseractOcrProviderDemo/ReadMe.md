##  TesseractOcrProvider

Since Q1 2025 the RadPdfProcessing library supports Optical Character Recognition (OCR). OCR is the electronic or mechanical conversion of images of typed, handwritten, or printed text into machine-encoded text from a scanned document. 
This project demonstrates how to use [TesseractOcrProvider](https://docs.telerik.com/devtools/document-processing/libraries/radpdfprocessing/formats-and-conversion/ocr/ocrformatprovider) that allows you to import an image to get a RadFixedPage.
